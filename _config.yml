          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          In HUFS, I had various chances to get along with students from abroad, so it helped me to be a multicultural individual who can get easy with exotic cultures.
